# About

`scentree` is a Python framework for generating scenario trees for multistage stochastic programming. It provides methods for generating a scenario fan using statistical models based on multivariate time series and machine learning techniques. The resulting scenario tree is then constructed using scenario reduction algorithms.

If the optimization problem to be solved is related to an energy community participating in electricity markets, the open-source [`secoem`](https://github.com/mmobec/secoem) package can be used after generating the scenario tree with the `scentree` package.


# Installation
The package is currently available only on `PyPI` and can be installed with:
```bash
pip install scentree
```

The package will be available on conda-forge soon.
